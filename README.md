# Word-End Analysis

This program in R analyzes a set of Spanish nouns and looks to see how reliable the last 1-4 letters of the noun are for predicting its gender. I wrote this program for a linguistics course on data analysis, and because as someone learning Spanish I have wondered if it's better to try to determine the gender by the ending of a word or to just memorize it. Enjoy! 

## Getting Started

This program can be run in RStudio. Make sure to change the file directory in RStudio to where you've saved the nouns.csv file. You can do this by going to File and then 'Change dir'.

### Prerequisites

At the start of the program, when you install the stringr library a menu will pop up asking to select a CRAN mirror. Select one that works for you and then the library will download.
